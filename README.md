### Hack Days

My idea for Hack Days revolves around **Augmented Reality**. 

Let's say, we are somehow able to encode the cart item data into a image pattern. My application will recognise that pattern and generate a 3d image of the item. In the prototype, I am making use of the pre-defined hiro pattern and generating a Cube with all it's properties defined in it's class. I have used the ARToolkit framework for the prototype. So, customers with the help of our companion application will be able to view the product in it's fully glory (as a virtual object) and it will be a totally magical experience for them. They can interact with the product in a way that's unique on its own. We can provide our customers with the facility to customise the product (like color,etc) in real-time. 

With this technology, we won't just be redefining commerce, we will be bringing an experience to our customers that's going to blow their minds.

If you select the *Hack Days prototype* option from the menu in the application **'ShopifyTask'**, a camera surface will be rendered waiting for the hiro pattern to be detected. Once the hiro pattern is detected, a 3d cube is generated over the pattern.
